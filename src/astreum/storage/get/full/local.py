    """Resolve an Expr and all transitive link hashes from local storage.

    Starts from a root hash (or an already-fetched Expr) and iteratively
    resolves every unresolved ``_head_hash`` / ``_tail_hash`` by fetching
    from local storage (hot → cold).  Returns a fully materialized
    expression tree with no remaining hash references.

    Args:
        node: A Node instance providing config and storage access.
        root: The content hash of the root expression, or an Expr
            instance that has already been fetched.

    Returns:
        The fully resolved Expr with all links expanded inline, or None
        if any part of the tree cannot be found in local storage.
